# Mongoose server Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the Mongoose server project. The tasks are
logically ordered and cover both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

- [x] Establish coding standards and best practices document

### Testing

- [X] Implement comprehensive unit test suite with higher coverage
- [X] Add integration tests for end-to-end event flow
- [X] Create performance benchmarks for event processing
- [X] Implement stress tests for high-volume event scenarios

### Configuration

- [x] Refactor configuration system to use a more type-safe approach
- [ ] Add validation for configuration parameters
- [ ] Implement hot reloading of configuration
- [ ] Create configuration templates for common use cases

### Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Implement metrics collection for event processing (throughput, latency)
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Enhance logging with structured logging format
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing for event flows

### Scalability and Performance

- [x] Optimize event queue implementations for higher throughput
- [ ] Implement backpressure mechanisms for event sources
- [ ] Add support for distributed event processing
- [ ] Optimize memory usage in high-volume scenarios

## Code-Level Improvements

### Error Handling

- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling strategy
- [x] Add retry mechanisms for failed event processing
- [x] Create error reporting and notification system
- [x] Improve error logging with more context

### Code Quality

- [x] Fix SuppressWarnings usage (replace with proper type safety)
- [x] Address TODO comments in the codebase
- [x] Implement consistent naming conventions
- [x] Reduce code duplication in event handling logic

### API Improvements

- [x] Create a more fluent API for event subscription
- [x] Improve service registration API
- [x] Add builder patterns for complex configurations
- [x] Create a more consistent exception hierarchy

### Dependency Management

- [x] Review and update external dependencies
- [x] Reduce coupling between components
- [x] Implement proper dependency injection
- [x] Create clear boundaries between modules

### Security

- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for admin operations
- [ ] Add input validation for all external inputs
- [ ] Implement secure configuration handling
- [ ] Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Technical Debt

### Code Cleanup

- [x] Remove experimental annotations where implementation is stable
- [x] Fix raw type usage in generics
- [x] Address compiler warnings
- [x] Remove unused code and dead code paths

### Refactoring

- [x] Refactor EventFlowManager to reduce complexity
- [x] Split MongooseServer class into smaller, focused classes
- [x] Improve thread safety in concurrent operations
- [x] Refactor service lifecycle management

### Testing Infrastructure

- [x] Create test utilities for common testing scenarios
- [x] Implement test fixtures for event processing
- [x] Add property-based testing for event handlers
- [x] Improve test isolation and repeatability

### Build and CI/CD
