# Mongoose server Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Mongoose server is an event-driven application framework designed to process events from various sources, route them to
appropriate handlers, and manage the lifecycle of event processors and services. This document provides a comprehensive
overview of the Mongoose server architecture, including component diagrams and descriptions of key components.

## High-Level Architecture

Mongoose server follows an event-driven architecture pattern where events flow from sources to processors through a
managed event flow system. The architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **MongooseServer** - The main server class that bootstraps and manages the entire system
2. **EventFlowManager** - Manages the flow of events between sources and processors
3. **EventSource** - Interfaces for components that generate events
4. **EventProcessors** - Components that process events
5. **Services** - Various services that provide functionality to the system

## Key Components

### MongooseServer

The MongooseServer class is the main entry point and controller for the system. It is responsible for:

- Bootstrapping the server with configuration
- Managing the lifecycle of event processors and services
- Registering event sources and services
- Coordinating the event flow

### EventFlowManager

The EventFlowManager is responsible for managing the flow of events between sources and processors. It:

- Registers event sources
- Maps events to appropriate processors
- Manages subscriptions between event sources and processors
- Provides the infrastructure for event routing

### Event Sources

Event sources are components that generate events. They implement the EventSource interface and are responsible for:

- Generating events from external or internal sources
- Publishing events to the event flow system
- Managing subscriptions from event processors

### Event Processors

Event processors consume and process events. They are managed by the ComposingEventProcessorAgent and are responsible
for:

- Subscribing to event sources
- Processing events according to business logic
- Generating output or side effects

### Services

Services provide various functionalities to the system. They can be:

- Event sources that generate events
- Event processors that consume events
- Standalone services that provide utility functions

## Event Flow Architecture

The event flow in Mongoose server follows this pattern:

1. Event sources generate events
2. Events are published to the EventFlowManager
3. EventFlowManager routes events to appropriate queues
4. Event processors consume events from queues
5. Event processors process events and may generate new events

```

## Configuration System

Mongoose server uses a configuration system based on YAML files. The configuration defines:

- Event sources and their properties
- Event processors and their grouping
- Services and their configuration
- Threading and performance settings

## Lifecycle Management

Mongoose server manages the lifecycle of components through these phases:

1. **Initialization** - Components are created and initialized
2. **Start** - Components are started and begin processing
3. **Running** - Normal operation where events are processed
4. **Stop** - Components are gracefully stopped
5. **Teardown** - Resources are released

## Threading Model

Mongoose server uses a threading model based on agents:

- Each event processor group runs in its own thread
- Services can run in their own threads or be hosted by agents
- Event queues provide thread-safe communication between components

## Conclusion

The Mongoose server architecture provides a flexible and scalable framework for building event-driven applications. Its
component-based design allows for easy extension and customization, while the event flow management system ensures
efficient routing and processing of events.
