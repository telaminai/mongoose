# Mongoose server Sequence Diagrams

## Introduction

This directory contains sequence diagrams that illustrate the key operations in the Mongoose server framework. Sequence diagrams are a type of UML diagram that show how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case. They are particularly useful for understanding the dynamic behavior of a system.

## Available Sequence Diagrams

1. [Event Subscription](event-subscription.md) - Illustrates the process by which event processors register their interest in receiving events from specific event sources.

2. [Event Processing](event-processing.md) - Shows the sequence of operations that occur when an event is generated by an event source and processed by event processors.

## How to Read the Sequence Diagrams

The sequence diagrams in this directory follow a standard format:

- Time flows from top to bottom
- Objects or components are represented as vertical lifelines
- Interactions between objects are shown as horizontal arrows
- Self-calls are represented as arrows that loop back to the same lifeline
- Notes provide additional context or explanations

## Relationship to Other Documentation

These sequence diagrams complement the other architecture documentation:

- [Architecture Overview](../overview.md) - Provides a high-level view of the system
- [Component Architecture](../components.md) - Describes the key components and their relationships
- [Event Flow Architecture](../event-flow.md) - Explains the event flow architecture in detail

The sequence diagrams provide a dynamic view of the system, showing how the components interact over time, while the other documentation provides a more static view of the system structure.

## Conclusion

The sequence diagrams in this directory provide a detailed view of the key operations in Mongoose server. They are a valuable resource for understanding how the system works and for diagnosing issues that may arise during development or operation.
