# Mongoose server Deployment Guide

## Introduction

This document provides guidance on deploying Mongoose server in various environments. It covers deployment considerations, performance tuning, and best practices to ensure optimal operation of Mongoose server applications.

## Deployment Models

Mongoose server can be deployed in several ways, depending on the requirements of your application:

### Standalone Application

Mongoose server can be deployed as a standalone Java application. This is the simplest deployment model and is suitable for many use cases.

#### Configuration:
```java
// Load configuration from a file
MongooseServer server = MongooseServer.bootServer(logRecordListener);

// Or programmatically
MongooseServerConfig mongooseServerConfig = new MongooseServerConfig();
// Configure mongooseServerConfig
MongooseServer server = MongooseServer.bootServer(mongooseServerConfig, logRecordListener);
```

### Embedded in Another Application

Mongoose server can be embedded within another Java application, such as a Spring Boot application or a web server.

#### Configuration:
```java
// Create and configure the server
MongooseServerConfig mongooseServerConfig = new MongooseServerConfig();
// Configure mongooseServerConfig
MongooseServer server = new MongooseServer(mongooseServerConfig);

// Register components
server.registerEventSource("source1", eventSource);
server.addEventProcessor("processor1", "group1", idleStrategy, () -> eventProcessor);

// Initialize and start
server.init();
server.start();
```

### Containerized Deployment

Mongoose server can be deployed in containers such as Docker, which provides isolation and portability.

#### Dockerfile Example:
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/fluxtion-server.jar /app/
COPY config/server-config.yaml /app/config/

ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2g -Xms1g"
ENV CONFIG_FILE="/app/config/server-config.yaml"

CMD ["java", "-jar", "fluxtion-server.jar", "-Dfluxtionserver.config.file=${CONFIG_FILE}"]
```

### Cloud Deployment

Mongoose server can be deployed to cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

#### Considerations:
- Use managed services for monitoring and logging
- Configure auto-scaling based on load
- Use cloud-native storage for persistence
- Implement proper security measures

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Configuration

Proper memory configuration is essential for optimal performance:

```
-Xmx<size>  # Maximum heap size
-Xms<size>  # Initial heap size
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=<size>  # Maximum metaspace size
```

Recommended settings:
- Set `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to the same value to avoid heap resizing
- Monitor memory usage and adjust as needed
- Consider using G1GC for large heaps: `-XX:+UseG1GC`

### Thread Configuration

Mongoose server uses a threading model based on agents. Configure threads appropriately:

```yaml
threadConfig:
  - name: "default"
    idleStrategy: "BusySpin"
  - name: "lowLatency"
    idleStrategy: "BusySpin"
  - name: "highThroughput"
    idleStrategy: "BackOff"
```

Considerations:
- Use `BusySpin` for low-latency requirements
- Use `BackOff` for high-throughput scenarios
- Balance the number of threads with available CPU cores

### Queue Sizing

Configure queue sizes based on expected load:

```java
// In EventFlowManager.java
new ManyToOneConcurrentArrayQueue<T>(queueSize);
```

Recommendations:
- Start with a queue size of 1024 or 2048
- Monitor queue overflow and adjust as needed
- Consider using different queue sizes for different event types

## High Availability

### Clustering

For high availability, deploy multiple instances of Mongoose server in a cluster:

1. **Active-Passive**: One active instance with one or more passive instances ready to take over
2. **Active-Active**: Multiple active instances sharing the load

### State Replication

If your application maintains state, consider state replication strategies:

1. **Shared Database**: Store state in a shared database
2. **Event Sourcing**: Rebuild state from event logs
3. **State Snapshots**: Periodically save and restore state snapshots

### Failover

Implement failover mechanisms to handle instance failures:

1. **Health Checks**: Regular health checks to detect failures
2. **Automatic Restart**: Restart failed instances automatically
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across healthy instances

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

Collect metrics to monitor the health and performance of your Mongoose server:

1. **JVM Metrics**: Heap usage, GC activity, thread count
2. **Application Metrics**: Event throughput, processing latency, queue sizes
3. **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O

### Logging

Configure appropriate logging to aid in troubleshooting:

```java
// Set log level for event processors
eventProcessor.setAuditLogLevel(EventLogControlEvent.LogLevel.INFO);
```

Recommendations:
- Use structured logging for easier parsing
- Configure appropriate log levels for different components
- Rotate logs to manage disk space

### Distributed Tracing

Implement distributed tracing to track events across components:

1. **Trace IDs**: Add trace IDs to events
2. **Span IDs**: Create spans for different processing stages
3. **Visualization**: Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to visualize traces

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

Implement proper authentication and authorization:

1. **API Security**: Secure admin APIs with authentication
2. **Role-Based Access**: Restrict access based on roles
3. **Secure Communication**: Use TLS for communication between components

### Data Protection

Protect sensitive data:

1. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
2. **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data in logs
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive data

### Network Security

Secure the network:

1. **Firewalls**: Restrict network access
2. **VPNs**: Use VPNs for secure communication
3. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate components in different network segments

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Files

Manage configuration files effectively:

1. **Version Control**: Store configuration files in version control
2. **Environment-Specific Configs**: Use different configurations for different environments
3. **Configuration Validation**: Validate configuration before deployment

### Dynamic Configuration

Consider dynamic configuration for runtime changes:

```java
// Update configuration at runtime
ConfigUpdate configUpdate = new ConfigUpdate();
configUpdate.setConfigMap(newConfigMap);
eventProcessor.onEvent(configUpdate);
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying Mongoose server to production, ensure:

1. **Performance Testing**: Test performance under expected load
2. **Security Review**: Review security measures
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Set up monitoring and alerting
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement backup and recovery procedures
5. **Documentation**: Document deployment procedures and configurations
6. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare a rollback plan in case of issues

## Conclusion

Deploying Mongoose server requires careful consideration of various factors including performance, high availability, monitoring, and security. By following the guidelines in this document, you can ensure a successful deployment that meets your application's requirements.

Remember that deployment is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. Continuously monitor, evaluate, and improve your deployment to maintain optimal performance and reliability.
