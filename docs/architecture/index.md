# Mongoose server Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Mongoose server project. The documentation is
organized into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the architecture.

## Table of Contents

1. [Architecture Overview](overview.md)

    - High-level architecture description
    - Main components and their relationships
    - System architecture diagrams

2. [Component Architecture](components.md)

    - Detailed description of key components
    - Component responsibilities
    - Class diagrams
    - Component relationships

3. [Event Flow Architecture](event-flow.md)
    - Event flow components
    - Event processing pipeline
    - Subscription model
    - Event types and wrapping
    - Queue implementation

4. [Agent Execution](agent-execution.md)
    - What agent execution is and how it differs from user threads
    - How agents are supported in Mongoose Server
    - When to choose agent execution; execution contexts (handlers vs services/feeds/sinks)

5. [Deployment Guide](deployment.md)
    - Deployment models
    - Performance considerations
    - High availability
    - Monitoring and observability
    - Security considerations
    - Configuration management
    - Deployment checklist

## How to Use This Documentation

- Start with the [Architecture Overview](overview.md) to get a high-level understanding of the system
- Dive into [Component Architecture](components.md) to understand the key components and their relationships
- Explore [Event Flow Architecture](event-flow.md) to understand how events flow through the system
- Refer to the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) when planning a deployment

## Diagrams

The documentation includes various diagrams to help visualize the architecture:

- System architecture diagrams
- Component interaction diagrams
- Event flow diagrams
- Class diagrams

These diagrams are provided in ASCII format for easy viewing in any text editor.
