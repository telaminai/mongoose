# Mongoose Server for Managers and Product Leaders

This page summarizes what Mongoose Server is, why teams adopt it, and how to evaluate it for your organization.

## What is it?
- A high‑performance, embeddable event‑driven server framework for Java.
- Composes event sources, processors (your business logic), sinks, and services with lifecycle and threading handled for you.
- Runs as an embedded library (multiple servers within a JVM) or as a standalone single‑server app.
- Saves money through efficiency: high throughput per core and zero‑GC hot paths mean fewer instances/cores for the same workload, lower cloud bills, and less operational overhead.

## Why teams adopt it
- Developer velocity: Compose common building blocks (feeds, handlers, sinks) quickly with minimal boilerplate.
- Predictable performance: Zero‑GC hot paths and configurable agent idle strategies achieve high throughput and tight tail latencies.
- Operational control: Admin commands, scheduling, logging/audit, and dynamic handler registration simplify operations.
- Extensibility: Clean plugin points for feeds/sinks/services; easy to add integrations.
- Partial migration is possible: Adopt Mongoose incrementally without a full-scale architectural migration; start with one pipeline or service and expand over time.
- Plugin ecosystem: A growing set of plugins promotes code reuse for common system integrations (e.g., Kafka, Aeron, Chronicle), reducing bespoke code and time-to-value.
- Cost efficiency from performance: High performance means greatly reduced costs to process data streams (fewer cores/instances for the same throughput, lower cloud and licensing spend).

## Where it fits
- Real‑time event processing and streaming within a JVM process.
- Low‑latency domains: trading, telemetry, IoT, control loops, in‑memory data processing.
- As a component within larger architectures (e.g., pre/post‑processing around Kafka, Aeron, Chronicle, databases).

## How it compares (qualitatively)
- Versus general stream processors (e.g., Flink/Beam): Mongoose is an embeddable, in‑JVM event pipeline for ultra‑low latency and developer control, not a distributed cluster.
- Versus actor toolkits (e.g., Akka, Vert.x): Mongoose focuses on event pipelines with explicit feeds/handlers/sinks and agent threads; simpler to reason about for dataflow, less about distributed actor semantics.
- Versus workflow/orchestrators (e.g., Netflix Conductor): Mongoose is for high‑rate event handling, not long‑running workflow orchestration.

## Evidence of performance
- Benchmarks show ~10M messages/second sustained and ≈270 ns average latency at 1M mps on commodity hardware.
- See Benchmarks: reports/server-benchmarks-and-performance.md (methodology and reproducibility included).

## Evaluation guide

- Fit assessment:
    - Latency SLOs: Do you need sub‑millisecond end‑to‑end processing?
    - Embedding: Will you run multiple pipelines per JVM or embed within existing services?
    - Extensibility: Do you need custom feeds/sinks/services via plugins?
  
- Pilot approach:
    - Start with the 5‑minute handler tutorial.
    - Implement a thin slice of business logic and one integration.
    - Measure on target hardware; tune idle strategies and batching.
- Production readiness checklist:
    - Define SLAs (throughput/latency) and test with production‑like load.
    - Set up monitoring/metrics and health endpoints.
    - Establish upgrade and rollback procedure.

## Cost/benefit themes
- Cost: Java team familiarity, learning the event pipeline and agent model.
- Benefit: Faster time‑to‑market for event processing, predictable low‑latency, and reduced operational toil through built‑in control features.

## FAQ for managers
- Can it run with existing messaging (Kafka, Aeron, Chronicle)? Yes, via plugins and adapters.
- Is it cloud‑ready? Yes—runs as a JVM process; provision CPU pinning and isolation if ultra‑low latency is required.
- Can we scale horizontally? Yes—run multiple instances behind a load balancer; Mongoose itself focuses on in‑process performance rather than cluster management.

## Next steps
- Review the Overview and Event Processing Architecture guides.
- Run the Hello Mongoose example and the Benchmarks on your hardware.
- Contact maintainers (open an issue/PR) to discuss integration patterns and roadmap.
