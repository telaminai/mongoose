# Mongoose Overview for Everyone

A simple way to think about Mongoose: it’s a tiny, high‑performance engine that sits inside your Java application and moves information from point A to point B, applies your rules, and gets it to where it needs to go—fast, reliably, and with low cost.

It helps teams build real‑time, event‑driven products (things that react to incoming data) without wrestling with plumbing or complex threading. You focus on your business logic; Mongoose takes care of the rest.

## Why teams use Mongoose

- Faster delivery
  - Reuse common building blocks for “inputs → business rules → outputs” instead of reinventing boilerplate.
  - Start small and add capabilities as you go.

- Predictable speed
  - Designed for high throughput and tight, consistent response times.
  - Tunable to match your latency or efficiency goals.

- Lower cost to run
  - Processes more work per CPU core, so you need fewer instances for the same workload.
  - Less operational overhead thanks to built‑in controls and clean architecture.

- Grows with you
  - Add integrations through plugins (e.g., popular messaging and data tools).
  - Adopt incrementally—no “big bang” rewrite required.

## Where Mongoose fits

- Real‑time experiences: live dashboards, alerts, personalization, IoT signals, telemetry.
- Low‑latency domains: trading, pricing, monitoring, control systems.
- In‑app data pipelines: pre/post‑processing around your messaging or databases.
- As a component inside larger architectures: run it alongside technologies you already use.

## How it works (in plain language)

- Inputs (Feeds): Think of these as the places where data arrives—market data, sensors, messages, logs.
- Your rules (Handlers): This is your business logic—what should happen when data arrives.
- Outputs (Sinks): Where results go—databases, dashboards, other systems.
- Shared services: Helpful utilities your rules can use (for example, caches or connections).
- Orchestration: Mongoose coordinates all the above and looks after threading, scheduling, and lifecycle so you don’t have to.

You design what should happen with incoming data; Mongoose keeps everything flowing smoothly.

## What makes it different

- Embedded and lightweight
  - Runs inside your application process—fast, simple, and under your control.
- Focused on events, not clusters
  - Built for in‑process, real‑time event handling rather than managing a distributed cluster.
- Clean separation of concerns
  - Business logic stays clean; infrastructure and plumbing are handled for you.
- Extensible by design
  - Clear plugin points for inputs, outputs, and services.

## Performance, simply stated

Mongoose is built for speed. Internal benchmarks demonstrate the ability to process millions of events per second with extremely low and consistent latency on commodity hardware. In practice, this means fewer machines to hit your throughput goals and more predictable performance for users.

## Operating and scaling

- Operability
  - Administrative controls, scheduling, logging, and audit support are built in.
  - Add or change handlers over time with confidence.
- Scaling
  - Run multiple instances behind a load balancer for horizontal scale.
  - Cloud‑friendly: deploy like any standard JVM process; tune for ultra‑low latency if needed.

## How to evaluate Mongoose

- Do you need real‑time or near real‑time responses?
- Do you care about consistent, predictable latency?
- Would you benefit from a simpler model for getting events in, applying rules, and getting results out?
- Are you looking to reduce infrastructure cost by doing more work per core?

If the answer to several of these is “yes,” Mongoose is likely a strong fit.

## Getting started (no heavy lift)

1. Take a 10‑minute tour
   - Read the high‑level overview and event‑processing architecture pages to see how the pieces fit.
2. Try a thin slice
   - Pick a single input, one or two rules, and a simple output. Measure on your hardware.
3. Expand thoughtfully
   - Tune for your latency or throughput goals; add additional feeds, handlers, or sinks as needed.
4. Talk to us
   - Open an issue or reach out to discuss patterns, plugins, and roadmap.

## The bottom line

Mongoose helps teams ship real‑time features faster, run them more cheaply, and operate them with confidence. It removes the infrastructure friction of event‑driven systems so you can put your effort where it matters most—delivering value to customers.
