/**
 * A base implementation class for managing AutoCloseable resources within an object pool.
 * This class extends BasePoolAware and implements AutoCloseablPoolAware to provide
 * foundational support for objects that need to be properly cleaned up when returned
 * to the pool. It is particularly useful for managing resources like database connections,
 * file handles, and network connections that require explicit cleanup.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses should implement specific cleanup logic for their managed resources
 * while leveraging the pooling infrastructure provided by this base class.
