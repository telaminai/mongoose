 * Represents a service interface for managing event flows within a system.

 * Services implementing this interface typically:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Register themselves as event sources with the event flow manager</li>
 *   <li>Manage event publishing and subscription lifecycles</li>
 *   <li>Support configuration of event wrapping and slow-consumer handling strategies</li>
 *   <li>Enable data mapping and transformation of published events</li>

 * @param <T> The type of events that this service publishes to subscribers
 * @see AbstractEventSourceService for a base implementation
